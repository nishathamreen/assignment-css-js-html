Given `n` always greater than -1, representing the block height. Now compute the units of water stored in-between the blocks.

so the water could only store when it is between 2 building. water should have building in the right side and
 left as well . water will not store if any of it side does not building.


so here the formula could be :

minimum(h1, h2)*(distance between the buildings-1)
